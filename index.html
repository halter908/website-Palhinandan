        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means helping people to learn 
            how to do things and support them to think about what they learn. It's also important for educators to teach ways to
             find and use information. Education needs research to find out how to make it better.[1][2]

            Through education, the knowledge of society, country, and of the world is passed on from generation to generation.
             This may include education in morality, for example learning how to act as loyal, honest and effective citizen. </p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big"> Types Of Education </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education is usually in school, where a person may learn basic, academic, or trade skills.
             Small children often attend a nursery or kindergarten but often formal education begins in elementary school and continues with 
             secondary school. Post-secondary education (or higher education) is usually at a college or university which may grant an academic degree.
              Or, students may go to a City college where they learn practical skills. This way learners can become qualified to be plumbers,
               electricians, builders and similar occupations. These course have arrangements for students to get practical experience. Apprenticeship 
               was the older way to do this</p>
